# **Space Invaders**
This project was created to solidify my learning of object oriented programming and Python. I built his game using the pygame module and utilizes object-oriented programming and algorithms. It is replayable and has a gameover screen. The executable file was created using pyinstaller and the rest of the files are the assets the game needs.
